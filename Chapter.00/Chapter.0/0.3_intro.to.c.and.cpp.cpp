 C language - 1972, systems programming language, to write OSs
 give lot of control to programmer, allow efficient access to memory, platform independence
 
 unix - most rewritten in c
 
 1978 - book called The C programming language, commonly known and K&R, also became a de fact
 o standard
 
 1983 - ANSI formed a committee to establish formal standard for C
 
 1989 - they finished and release the c89 standard, known as ansi C
 
 1990 - ISO adopted ANSI C, and it became C90, compilers became C90 compliant, so
 program which requires max. portability were coded to this standard
 
 1999 - ANSI released C99, it adopted many features which had already made their
 way into compilers as extension, or had been implemented in C++.
 
 
 
 C++ language - an extension to C, 1979
 object oriented language
 
 1998 - standardized by the ISO, to ensure all compilers adhere to the same set
 of standards
 
 2003 - minor update to C++ called C++03
 
 Four major updates to the C++ language (C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20)
 
 C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities, new baseline versio
 n of the language(considered)
 
 C++23 already starting to be formulated.
 
 Each new formal release of the language is called a language standard
 
 
 
 
 C and C++’s philosophy
 design philosophy of c and cpp : "trust the programmer"
 so high degree of freedom to do what they want
 
 C++ good at following :
 video games
 Real-time systems (e.g. for transportation, manufacturing, etc…)
 High-performance financial applications (e.g. high frequency trading)
 Graphical applications and simulations
 Productivity / office applications
 Embedded software
 Audio and video processing
 Artificial intelligence and neural networks
 
 C : these days most used for code that runs on embedded devices
 when you need to interact with other languages that can only interface with C
 
 For most other cases, C++ is recommended.
