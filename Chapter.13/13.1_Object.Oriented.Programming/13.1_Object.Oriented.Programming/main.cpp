 Object in C++: a piece of memory that can be used to store values
 
 An object with a name: is called a variable
 
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Procedural programming: the programs are basically lists of instructions to the computer
 that define data via objects and then work with that data via statements and functions
 
 Data and functions that work on that data: are separate entities that are combined together
 to produce the desired result
 
 Data and functions: both are separate, functions work on the data to get desired results
 
 Procedural programming: often doesn't provide a very intuitive representation of reality
 
 Properties: variables
 
 Behaviors : functions

                        !!!!!OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING!!!!!!
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Everywhere you look: are objects
 
 Example of real life objects: books, mobile, car, buildings, food etc.
 
 Two major components of an object:
 -it has its relevant properties like weight, color, size, shape etc.
 -it has some number of behaviors that it can exhibit like doing, making, opening etc.
 
 Properties and behaviors: both are inseparable
 
 Object Oriented Programming: provides the ability to create objects that tie together both
 properties and behaviors into a self-contained, reusable package, it is focused on defining
 objects that have a well defined set of behaviors
 
 OOP: allow programs to be written in a more modular fashion, which makes them easier to
 write and understand and also provide a high degree of code reusability, these objects also
 provide a more intuitive way to work with our data by allowing us to define how we interact
 with the objects and how they interact with other objects
 
 OOP: has inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction & polymorphism concepts
 
 Object in OOP: it is both an object in traditional programming sense and it combines both
 properties and behaviors
