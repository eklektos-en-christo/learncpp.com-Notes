/*
 Watching variables: process of inspecting the value of a
 variable while the program is executing in debug mode.
 
 The watch window: window where you can add variables you
 would like to continually inspect, and these variables
 will be updated as you step through your program
 The watch window can evaluate expressions too
 
 Local watches: If you’re just looking to watch the value of
 a local variable, check the locals window first. It
 should already be there.
