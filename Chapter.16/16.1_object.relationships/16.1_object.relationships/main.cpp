 Programming: is full of recurring patterns, relationships and hierarchies, the same
 patterns that govern real-life objects are applicable to the programming objects we create
 ourselves. By examining these in more detail we can better understand how to improve code
 reusability and write classes that are more extensible
 
 Some examples of recurring patters: loops, functions to do a particular task many times,
 enums, structs and classes to allow us to instantiate objects of a given type
 
 Some primitive forms of hierarchy: arrays to group similar elements into a larger structure
 and recursion, where a function calls a derivative version of itself
 
 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OBJECTS: we use specific "relation type" words to describe these
 relationships.
 
 Example:
 
 - a square "is-a" shape
 - a car "has-a" steering wheel
 - a computer programmer "uses-a" keyboard
 - a flower "depends-upon" a bee for pollination
 - a student is a "member-of" a class
 - a brain exists as "part-of" the body
 
 Relation types:
 
 "part-of"
 "has-a"
 "uses-a"
 "depends-on"
 "member-of"
 "is-a"
