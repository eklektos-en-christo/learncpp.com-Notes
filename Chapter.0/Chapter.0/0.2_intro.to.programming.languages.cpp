/*
 Machine language : first programs were written in machine language
 
 Assembly language : invented to make things easier for programmers
 
 Assembler : program used to convert assembly code into machine code
 
 High level languages : developed to solve the readability and portability
 
 compiler : converts hll program into machine executable code
 steps in compilation : hll source > compiler > executable > hardware > results
 
 interpreter : directly executes the instructions without compiling the whole
 code first and making an executable of it. they are less efficient than compil
 ers because everytime program run the interpretation is needed but in compili
 ng the compilation is done one time and executable is produced to run it any
 where.
 steps in interpretation : hll source > interpreter > hardware > results
 
 note : java is compiled as well as interpreted language
 
 HLL : easier to read and write
 
 programs : compiled and interpreted for different systems, only recompilation
 for that platform cpu is needed. compiler for that cpu is available
 like compiler for 32 bit hardware, powerpc, mips hardware are available
 
 exceptions to portability :
        platfrom specific capabilities - much easy to write codefor specificOS
        compiler specific extensions - code won't compile on another compiler
